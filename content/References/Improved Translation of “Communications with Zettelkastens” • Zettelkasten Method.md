# My Highlights

- I. ^43175eec

- Zettelkastens can be recommended as communication partners because of the technical-economic problem of doing science. Without writing, you cannot think; at least not in a sophisticated and scientific way. ^02e14df4

- You have to highlight differences somehow and record distinctions either explicitly or embedded in concepts; only the hereby secured consistency of the schema that produces information guarantees the coherence of the subsequent information processing. ^f3e6fe43

- It is an obligatory condition for communication that both partners can surprise each other. Only in that way can information be created in the respective other. ^9b25e61d

- Information is an event that happens inside the system. Information is created when a message, an entry \[of a note\], is compared with other possibilities. Therefore, information is only created in systems that possess a comparison schema (even when this schema is merely: “this or something else”). ^cf3c2959

- For communication to be possible, it is not required that both communication partners have the same comparison schema; the level of surprise even increases when this is not the case, and when you consider it to be a coincidence that a message is meaningful or even useful against a background of other possibilities. Put differently: the variety in the communicating system increases if it can happen that both partners communicate successfully (meaning: useful for one communication partner) in spite of their different comparison schemas. ^209bfce7

- This requires randomness to be built into the system. “Randomness” means: It is not guaranteed that the comparison schemata match or that the information that is transmitted by the communication [2](#fn2) are accurate, but that information is created through the interaction of both partners. ^85c5a6a2

- There are two ways for a communication system to maintain its integrity over long periods of time: you need to decide for either highly technical specialisation, or for a setup that incorporates coincidence and _ad hoc_ generated information. Translated to note collections: you can choose a setup categorized by topics, or an open one. ^4d2186b4

- Naturally, a setup of a communicating system that is meant to be enduring, open, and not topically restricted (it is restricted by itself) needs to adhere to certain structural requirements. ^ba26e7c2

- II. ^2d292155

- However, the external form just has an effect on convenience and not the power of the Zettelkasten. The inner workings, the arrangement of the notes, the mind of the Zettelkasten depend on a decision not to order notes by topics and subtopics, and instead choose an order with fixed placement. ^49fb18eb

- A content-based system (like a book’s table of contents) would mean that you would have to adhere to a single structure forever (decades in advance!). If you assume that this communication system and oneself can evolve, this will necessarily result in unsolvable problems where to place a note. ^f5d0b1d0

- This structural decision is exactly that reduction of complexity of possible arrangements that unlocks the creation of high complexity within the Zettelkasten and thus creates its ability to communicate in the first place. ^1ea0a026

- (1) _Free internal branching._ You don’t need to add notes at the end, but you can connect them anywhere, even to single words within a text. ^a4001777

- There can be multiple possible connections on each note. This enables internal growth of the system without systematic pre-programming and without depending on sequential linearity. ^7a99551c

- (2) _Opportunity to connect._ Because all notes have a fixed number, you can create as many references on each note as you want. Central concepts could be laden with a lot of references that indicate in which other contexts related information can be found. ^49fcd5aa

- (3) _Register._ Considering that there is no topical order, you have to put a search mechanism in place because you cannot rely on your numerical memory. ^ddf1f8b0

- You can connect a parallel tool with your literature management system. Bibliographical notes that you extract from literature should be captured inside the Zettelkasten. ^76ca9d49

- Books, articles, etc. that you actually have read should each get individual notes that belong in a separate section and that contain the bibliographical information. ^33ee8434

- This allows you in the longer run to distinguish what source you have actually read and what source you have just collected for later use. ^962678d4

- The bibliographical notes also allow you to add references to the notes that are based on these sources, or that were inspired by them. ^92bf8a8c

- The result of working with this technique for a long time is a kind of second memory, an alter ego with which you can always communicate. It has, similar to our own memory, no pre-planned comprehensive order, no hierarchy, and surely no linear structure like a book. And by that very fact, it is alive independently of its author. ^83d5ee90

- Something will seep away. Some notes you will never see again. On the other hand, there are preferred hubs, cluster formations, and parts with which you work more often than with others. There will be large projected idea complexes that are never realised; and there are minor ideas that enrich themselves and accumulate; starting at a subsidiary part of the text, [6](#fn6) and tending to dominate the system. ^91fe24e6

- To summarise: this technique ensures that the order – which is just _pro forma_ – does not become a mental straightjacket, but adapts itself to the thought development. ^2df0944b

- Knowledge theory has given up the assumption of “privileged concepts” that function as axiomatic foundations to control the logical value of other concepts or propositions. [7](#fn7) Similarly, you must give up the assumption that there are privileged places, notes of special and knowledge-ensuring quality. ^01e76582

- Each note is just an element that gets its value from being a part of a network of references and cross-references in the system. A note that is not connected to this network will get lost in the Zettelkasten, and will be forgotten by the Zettelkasten. ^b6ba4632

- III. ^2e47c58e

- The Zettelkasten needs a couple of years to reach critical mass. Until then, it is merely a container from which you get what you put in. This changes with increasing size and complexity. ^6f4a73d0

- You can store nearly everything, and not merely ad hoc and in isolation, but with the possibility of internal connections. It becomes a sensitive system that internally reacts to many ideas, as long as you can note them down. ^b3a02530

- You could ask, for example, why museums are empty while exhibitions of _Monet_, _Picasso_, _Medici_ are overcrowded; the Zettelkasten accepts this question through the connection of “preference for what is limited in time”. Certainly, as this example tries to show, the internally available connections are selective. They lie in the realm of the non-obvious, because the system boundary between the note taker and the Zettelkasten has to be crossed. ^b89a5919

- A new entry can also isolate itself – for example through a new keyword _Picasso_ for the Picasso exhibition. However, if you try to communicate with your Zettelkasten you have to look for internal connection opportunities that result in something unexpected (i.e., information). You can try to generalise the experiences from Paris, Florence, New York via general concepts like “art” or “exhibition” or “crowding (interactionistic)” or “crowd” or “freedom” or “culture” and see whether the Zettelkasten reacts. It is usually most productive to search for problem statements that relate heterogeneous concepts to each other. ^56ae8dee

- In any case, the communication is enriched if you succeed to activate the internal network of connections upon note entry and retrieval. Human memory also does not operate as the result of item-by-item accesses, but uses internal relationing and is only productive in the sphere of reduction of its own complexity. ^52007ea5

- In this way – at this point in space and time and caused by the search impulse – more information becomes available than expected during the search query; and particularly more information than has ever been stored in the form of notes. ^bb3ef987

- The Zettelkasten provides combinatorial possibilities that were never planned, never pre-meditated, or never designed in this way. This innovation mechanism is on the one hand based on the search query’s ability to provoke relational possibilities that were never laid out; on the other hand, on meeting internal selection horizons and comparison opportunities that are not identical to its own search schema. ^2ad4e6ac

- Compared to this structure that offers actualizable connection possibilities, the relevance of the actual content of the note subsides. Much of it quickly becomes useless or is unusable for a concrete occasion. That is true for both collected quotes, which are only worth collecting when they are exceptionally concise, and for your own thoughts. ^d4016824

- Scientific publications thus don’t emerge, at least from my experience, by copying the note content that was intended for publishing. The communication with the Zettelkasten becomes productive only on more abstract way, namely on the sphere of communicative relationing of relations. And it becomes productive only in the moment of evaluation, meaning time-bound and highly incidentally. ^871da5c3

- IV. ^2041e16a

- But if you think in evolutionary models, randomness has a prominent role. [9](#fn9) Without it, nothing progresses anyhow. ^2b2a3a1e

- Without variation on given ideas, there are no possibilities of scrutiny and selection of innovations. Therefore, the actual challenge becomes generating incidents with sufficiently high chances of selection. ^555094f3

- We know from analyses of mutation processes in the realm of organic evolution that mutations are complex and finely regulated processes, and only have the stability that is necessary for selective success if they are subjected to pre-selection. They are incidents in the sense that they are not coordinated with the factors that select; but they are nevertheless conditioned by complex regulations themselves. ^7752677a

- The allegory shouldn’t be overused; but you wouldn’t go wrong by assuming that in the social domain, and especially in scientific research, order also emerges from the combination of order and disorder. [10](#fn10) his specification of emergence does not negate scrutinization, it rather enables it. ^c08540af

- On this abstract level of communication that is related to the philosophy of science as well as towards empirical research, the Zettelkasten is surely just one of many possibilities. Incidents during reading play a role, and even misunderstandings caused by interdisciplinary thought processes. ^82d30bad

- Last but not least, the traditional “unity of research and education” is a source of friction that generates incidents. We can confirm that communication with Zettelkastens, compared to other options, is a viable solution and has many advantages regarding information density, speed, and mutual amenability. ^90e8ec70
