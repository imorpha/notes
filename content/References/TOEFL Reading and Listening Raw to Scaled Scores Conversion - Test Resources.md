# My Highlights

- As indicated, every test has a different conversion. This means that sometimes you need to answer every single question correctly to get a perfect score, but sometimes you can make a few mistakes and still get a perfect score. The conversion is based on the difficulty of the specific test. ^3572771e

- “…despite the best efforts of test designers, no two test forms can ever be exactly alike. Each form is composed of different questions, which means that each test form differs slightly from other test forms in its level of difficulty. Therefore, number-correct (raw) scores are bound to a specific test form and are not directly comparable across forms.” (source) ^6b127d15

- The difficulty of a given test is determined through a process called equating. In practice, this means that each test contains questions that have been “pre-tested” in the past. ^47256e2f

- How about the Speaking and Writing Sections?
Oh, who the f–k knows? I’ll write an article about them in the future, but now that the e-rater and SpeechRater are used it is impossible to know exactly how the questions are graded. We know how about the raw scores from human graders, but the AI technology is mysterious. We don’t even know how the human and AI are weighed. Just note that the speaking and writing scores are adjusted up and down depending on the difficulty of a given test. I think. ^032a7d4c
