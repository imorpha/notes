# My Highlights

- They seem to have Flesch-Kinkaid levels between 30 and 50, which means they are similar to content from a textbook for first-year university students. ^2eec4ebc

- You can expect to get articles about any topics that a freshman student might study, but my examination of official ETS practice tests indicate that the most common topics on the test are:
	- History
	- Zoology
	- Physical Geography
	- Biology
	- Geology ^50893416

- Note that history is the most common topic by far, so be sure to practice by reading articles about history as much as you can. ^ab6dd54f

- Remember that the articles are all introductory level, so you don’t need special background knowledge to understand them and answer the questions. That said, having background knowledge can’t hurt… so remember to spend time before the test reading short articles about topics like these. A great source of short articles is ScienceNews. ^8af36a89

- If a very technical term is used in an article, a short definition may be provided as a footnote. ^de59e2c9

## Multiple Choice Questions

### 1. Factual Information Questions

- find specific details or information that is stated in the article ^e2a8fe3c

- They look something like this:
	- According to the paragraph, why did X…
	- The author’s description of X mentions which of the following? ^174d8d29

- According to the paragraph, why did X…
	- The author’s description of X mentions which of the following? ^06767b06

- To answer these questions, look specifically for the requested information. Don’t select an answer just because it includes a word that appears in the article. Incorrect answer choices often include details that appear in the article, but are not connected to information requested in the question. ^114a8aef

- This is the most frequent question type in the reading section. Expect to get between 1 and 3 factual information questions per article. ^90c13f88

### 2. Negative Factual Information Questions

- identify specific information or details that are not mentioned in the article ^888d9ffc

- They usually look like this:
	- According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true of X?
	- The author’s description of X mentions all of the following EXCEPT…
	- In paragraph X, each of the following is mentioned about Y, EXCEPT… ^a3d2c94d

- According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true of X?
	- The author’s description of X mentions all of the following EXCEPT…
	- In paragraph X, each of the following is mentioned about Y, EXCEPT… ^f51aad70

- According to the passage, which of the following is NOT true of X?
	- The author’s description of X mentions all of the following EXCEPT…
	- In paragraph X, each of the following is mentioned about Y, EXCEPT… ^0b600f80

- These questions are very time-consuming, since you will need to read the entire paragraph very carefully. Give yourself more time to solve this question than most other question types. ^2ec8e6ee

- This is a fairly common question type. Expect to get about 1 or 2 per article. ^52cc1665

### 3. Inference Questions

- make logical connections between details in the article and claims which are not mentioned in the article ^34e35413

- What can be inferred from paragraph X about Y?
	- The author of the article implies that X… ^ff2b7357

- Once again, you should try to avoid picking answer choices just because they contain words which appear in the article. Look for details in the article that express cause and effect relationships, or sequences of events. ^adcb8892

- This is an uncommon question type. Expect to get between 0 and 1 per article. ^771d7633

### 4. Rhetorical Purpose Questions

- why the author of the article mentions a specific detail ^f806e926

- They often look like:
	- Why does the author of the article mention X?
	- In paragraph X, why does the author mention Y? ^b618e3f4

- look for sentences that use supporting examples. The articles often use such examples to illustrate a concept, to show how two things are similar, or to contrast two things. ^f0bd74de

- These are fairly common questions. Expect to see between 0 and 2 per article. ^a811fdbe

### 5. Vocabulary Questions

- A single word or phrase is highlighted and you must pick the best synonym from four possible choices. ^4b4f1402

- Vocabulary questions usually look like:
	- The word X in the paragraph is closest in meaning to… ^ce9f7d6d

- The key to mastering this question type is to pick an answer quickly. Don’t spend too much time thinking about the answer. In most cases you will either know the answer or will not know the answer. You probably won’t find too many clues in the rest of the paragraph. If you don’t know the answer right away, just make a guess and move on. ^0297a500

### 6. Reference Questions

- make connections between words. Generally, you will be asked to identify what words like “it” or “this” refer to. ^86aa2f54

- They look like this:
	- The word “it” in paragraph X refers to… ^d87869a4

- Try replacing the given word with each of the answer choices. If the sentence still makes sense in the context of the paragraph, the answer choice may be correct. ^02094585

### 7. Sentence Simplification Questions

- your ability to understand the meaning of a sentence and how to paraphrase it. ^554757d6

- They usually look like this:
	- Which of the following best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence? Incorrect answer choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information. ^9c62b3d7

- To determine the meaning of the highlighted sentence, focus on words that provide additional details, rather than words which just serve a grammatical purpose. Correct answer choices often retain many of the same details, but alter words which are merely for grammar. ^8adb8cd9

### 8. Sentence Insertion Questions

- you will be given a new sentence, and you must determine where it fits best in the paragraph. ^428b8c32

- The question usually looks like this:
	- Where would the following sentence best fit? ^2908a994

- Pay attention to the purpose of the given paragraph, and how it is presenting information. Try to determine if it is depicting a sequence of events. Or if it is becoming more specific as it continues. Or if it is describing a cause and effect relationship. If you know the flow of the paragraph, you will have an easier time determining where the sentence fits. This is one of the most time-consuming questions. Give yourself extra time to complete it. ^9b24d6b3

- Every article has just one insert sentence question, and it is always the final multiple choice question. ^ff256fca

## Summary/Table Questions

### 1. Summary Questions

- You will see a list of six sentences. Most of them will express an idea from the article. A few may express an idea not stated in the article. You must identify which three sentences express the main ideas of the article. ^c22675d5

- The order you place them in doesn’t matter. ^72ad060f

- To solve this question, first eliminate sentences that express ideas not stated in the article. Next, eliminate sentences that express supporting ideas or evidence. ^2ed36449

### 2. Table Questions

- This is a rare question type, but it occasionally appears. If it does appear, it will be the last question following an article, and you will not get a summary question for that article. ^3713359b

- You will see a table divided into two or three categories. You will also see a list of words or short sentences that reflect ideas or things from the article. There will usually be about seven of them. ^cede3e7d

- For instance, following a zoology article the categories might be “vertebrates” and “invertebrates,” while the given sentences could be various features of animals. In this case, you should drag the statements into the right part of the table. ^28db5252

- Some of the sentences will not be stated in the reading and should not be placed in the table. For example, if you see seven sentences, there will be room for only five of them in the chart. ^e79c3c2b
