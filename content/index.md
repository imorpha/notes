## 📝 Learning
- [[Learning as a side effect]]
- [[Attention is the basis for all skills]]
## 🧑🏻‍💻 Productivity

- [[Instagram lite is the best way to browse Instagram]]
- [[Separation of concerns in app usage]]
- [[Setting session time limits helps with procrastination]]
- [[To-do items should be clear and immediately actionable]]
## 🧠 Brain & Psyche
