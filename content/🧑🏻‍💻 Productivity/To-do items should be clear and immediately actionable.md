Most of the time when we procrastinate, it's because there is no clear, immediately actionable, next item on our list. It's impossible to start doing the task when you don't know what the task is. Take the time to break down the task into smaller parts and write down the next action clearly and without any room for vagueness. Always avoid broad actions like "continue the project".
