There are many different task manager apps, each offering various features. However, I've come to notice that none of those bells and whistles are as important as these:

- It has to be fast and snappy.
- It should make it obvious which of the deadlines have been broken down and have time blocks planned for.
- It should make it obvious which of the blocks have a flexible time and which ones don't.
- It should have color-coding so I can see at a glance the distribution of time and balance between different kinds of tasks, like work and leisure.
