The concept of separation of concerns in programming can also be applied to app usage to better manage our attention.

Some apps are all-in-one solutions. People do everything in email, or more specifically for Iranians, Telegram. Inside Telegram, people:
- do private, work, and study chats
- store their book files
- store their music files
- store important links in it
- create blog channels
- write a to-do list.

This is the opposite of separation of concerns. The problem with this approach is that when these different functions mix, they interfere with each other.
For example, when you want to check if you've taken your medicine, you don't need to see your university assignments. Or, when you want to listen to music, you don't need to see your company tasks. Conversely, when you want to open the PDF of your textbook, it's better not to be distracted by who Mammad saw today or what new gossip Soraya has to share.
Each of these functions can be completely separated and perform their tasks more efficiently and cleanly without interfering with each other.
Additionally, all this context switching makes the mind more distractible over time and gradually reduces [[Attention is the basis for all learning|the ability to concentrate deeply and for long periods of time]].

The solution is separation of concerns. That means identifying functions that can work independently and separating them as much as possible.
For example, in Telegram itself, we can use the folder and archive features, or turn off notifications. Or even better, use a different app for each of these tasks: work chats in Slack, [[Important features in a planner app|personal tasks in Todoist]], writing in Obsidian, reading in Omnivore, etc.
Once you do this, you realize that apart from the benefits of separation itself, each of these apps, being designed for a specific function, performs that task much better than a multipurpose app.

It's really gratifying that Telegram has these features like folders, archive, and notification management. Some apps, like [[Instagram lite is the best way to browse Instagram|Instagram]], are deliberately designed to mess up your brain. But that's a discussion for another day.
