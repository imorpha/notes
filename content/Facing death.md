There is a certain clarity of mind that results from facing death. One would be lucky to have a near-death experience and continue living, thereby feeling all the usual regrets that people often have later in life, or more accurately, too late in life, much sooner. It is one thing to 'know', intellectually, what it means to have a finite time on this earth; it is a whole other thing to actually 'feel' it in your flesh and bones. That form of confrontation is only possible when facing the actual inevitability of death soon to come.
