this has 2 benefits:
1. it opens me up to change and to not resist it.
2. doesn't limit my behavior to only certain things.
example:
- in painting, i enjoy the color aspect so much. with this, i can make one of two possible conclusions:
	1. i am a person who loves color in painting above all else
	2. it just means that i love working with color at this moment. it doesn't say anything about other aspects and it doesn't mean that it won't change in the future. i may start liking other things when i experience them.
