If you don't set time limits for a session, you will probably subconsciously stop doing the task when it's least interesting to continue. It's either become boring, or you've reached a problem you don't know how to solve. 
It's a better approach to apply intentionality even to when you stop the session. This makes it much easier to start the task in the next session because:
- [[To-do items should be clear and immediately actionable|you know exactly what you should be doing]].
- you don't lack confidence in being able to do it.
- it's probably not something that bores you. 
Leave the vague, difficult, or boring parts of the task to the later parts of the session, when you're in the flow and it's easiest to do them.
