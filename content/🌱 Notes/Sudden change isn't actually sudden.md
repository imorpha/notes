People's experiences with things don't always reflect what's actually going on in their brains.

Take someone who's overcome addiction, for instance. Ask them how they got sober, and they might say, 'One day, I just decided enough was enough and stopped using.' They perceive it as a sudden change, but the reality is a much longer, complex process in their brain, one they're not even fully aware of.

Consider procrastination. The advice often given is to 'just do it.' This might come from those who've never experienced the mental state of a chronic procrastinator, or even from those who have but managed to change. They're likely oblivious to the intricate mental process they went through to reach that point of action.

So when you try to emulate their experience, telling yourself to 'just do it' or 'enough is enough' often fails. It doesn't work because it's not what has actually happened in their brains. And as you see no change, the growing disappointment in altering that behavior only intensifies.
