When we learn something, be it playing the piano, drawing, writing, programming, yoga, or even interpersonal skills like listening to people, attention precedes it. The quality of our attention directly determines the quality of our skill. By increasing the span and the intensity of our attention, we improve in nearly every skill, from any field of work or areas of life. This shows the importance of meditation, as an exercise to improve the quality of attention.
