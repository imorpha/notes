People have a tendency to attach their identity to their interests and also things they find unattractive. Avoiding this behavior, has some benefits: It **opens you up to change** and helps you not resist it when the need comes, and **doesn't put limits** on the set of behaviors that you think you are able to do.

For example, when you enjoy X, instead of going with the thought that you are the kind of person that enjoys X, just acknowledge the experience of enjoyment in that moment and move on. Because there might come a time where you don't enjoy X anymore or enjoy things completely opposite to it. In the case that this happens, there won't be a blow to your sense of identity.
