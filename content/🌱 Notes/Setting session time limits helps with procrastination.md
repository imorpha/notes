If I don't set time limits for a session, I will probably subconsciously stop doing the task when it's least interesting to continue. It's either become boring, or I've reached a problem I don't know how to solve. 
It's a better approach to apply intentionality even to when I stop the session. This makes it much easier to start the task in the next session because:
- [[To-do items should be clear and immediately actionable|I know exactly what I should be doing]].
- I don't lack confidence in my competence to do it.
- it's probably not something that bores me. 

Leave the vague, difficult, or boring parts of the task to the later parts of the session, when I'm in the flow and it's easiest to do them.
