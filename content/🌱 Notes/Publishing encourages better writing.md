I've come to notice that publishing what I create encourages me to do it more, faster, and better. In the case of writing, it makes me write more clearly and in a more structured way. However, this goes against Andy Matuschak's advice to [[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience|write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience]]. He goes on to state the following:

![[Write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience#^01a9efcb]]

There haven't been any such blockage for me so far. I _am_ writing notes for myself, but imagining the possibility of someone else reading my notes, encourages me to write more cohesively, which in turn makes me think more clearly.
