Something has fundamentally changed about the way we consume new content now compared to the time before the Internet was a thing. When reading novels, for example, we went head first into the book knowing next to nothing about its content, or other people's reviews of it. Or when buying a new game, we could only see the cover of the disk and some screenshots on the back and that was it. Since YouTube wasn't as accessible as it is now, we couldn't browse videos of other people playing the games and then decide on whichever game that suited our taste.

This, I argue, lowers the overall satisfaction the experience brings us during a time which paradoxically, the quality of content has generally improvedâ€”especially in the case of games. There are two reasons for this:
1. The paradox of choice
2. The sense of wonder and curiosity, which I think comprises a significant part of the experience, is now nullified.
