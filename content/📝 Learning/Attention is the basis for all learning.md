When we learn something, be it playing the piano, drawing, writing, programming, yoga, or even interpersonal skills like listening to people, attention precedes it. The quality of our attention directly determines the quality of our learning. By increasing the span and the intensity of our attention, we improve in each and every skill, from any field of work or areas of life. This implies:
- the importance of meditation, as an exercise to improve the quality of attention
- getting better in any skill will make us better in any other skill, since while learning something we also get better at working with our attention
