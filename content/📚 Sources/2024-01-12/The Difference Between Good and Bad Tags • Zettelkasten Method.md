# My Highlights

- **Tags for topics.** You use tags to group notes under a topic. ^d7ea61cc

- **Tags for objects.** You use tags to group notes around an object, real or conceptual. ^bd53b2aa

- The difference between these types of tags is very easily understood. If I use tags for topics I would tag everything that is relevant for the topic of diet with `#diet`. A note about carbohydrate intake and insulin sensitivity would definitely fulfill this criterion. If I use tags for objects, I would only tag notes with `#diet` when these notes are specifically on the concept of dieting. I would not tag the note on insulin sensitivity with `#diet`. But I’d use the tag for a note on metabolic flexibility as overarching concept that connects diet and fasting. ^7bf594f8

- I don’t want broad general connections because they are not very useful in the long run. The connection in itself should be a piece of knowledge that adds to the value of my archive. A precise, lucid, and insightful connection should be placed. ^ec0ebd37

- The tags for objects are much more precise and reveal real connections. They narrow down the search way more which is hugely important if your archive grows. They only give you what you want, and not the topic which also contains what you want. ^b4d82b3a
