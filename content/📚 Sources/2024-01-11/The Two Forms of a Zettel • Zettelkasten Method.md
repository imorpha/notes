# My Highlights

- Separateness is a direct consequence of the uniqueness of the Zettel.
Connections are only possibilities.  ^d4f821db

- Without seperateness and possibility of connection you have just a random note. ^d26b2002

- The meta data includes information on the Zettel itself. The content includes information about something else. ^3f9dd447

- Even if you only decide to have a unique title you still have a title which is an identifier. This is meta data. ^369a0243
