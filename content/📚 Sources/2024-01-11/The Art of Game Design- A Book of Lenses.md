# My Highlights

- #1 The Lens of Emotion People may forget what you said, but they’ll never forget how you made  them feel. —Maya Angelou To make sure the emotions you create are the right ones, ask yourself these  questions: ● What emotions would I  like my player to experi- ence? Why? ● What emotions are play- ers (including me) hav- ing when they play now?  Why? ● How can I bridge the  gap between the emo- tions players are having  and the emotions I’d like  them to have? ^6abdb8e7

- Game design is the act of deciding what a game should be. ^2ef2024c

- #2 The Lens of Essential Experience ^d3d5d0d0

- To use this lens, you stop  thinking about your game  and start thinking about the  experience of the player. Ask  yourself these questions: ● What experience do I  want the player to have? ● What is essential to that  experience? ● How can my game cap- ture that essence? ^4ff09ab7
