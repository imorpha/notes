# My Highlights

- We’ve long defined the difference between humans and animals by our ability to think. Aristotle wrote: “The life of the intellect is the best and pleasantest for man, for the intellect more than anything else is man; therefore, a life guided by intellect is the best for man.” ^11792688

- Anton Chekhov agreed in his novella, _Ward No. 6_: “Intellect draws a sharp line between the animals and man, \[and\] suggests the divinity of the latter.” ^0fe4840b

- The primacy of thinking and the intellect as _the_ feature by which we define ourselves has become even more salient as we’ve moved from an economy driven by industrial labor into one driven by knowledge. ^d545516b

- If AI can now write, and, worse, think, what’s left that makes humans unique? ^ba2b945a

- Our fuzzy definition of the intellect is why our first encounter with ChatGPT and its ilk can be so terrifying. It touches a lightning rod within us. For millennia we’ve set ourselves apart by a strange, amorphous, many-dimensional thing called intelligence—and suddenly there is something encroaching on our turf. ^791003c2

- In order to regain our sense of self and place in the world, we need to redefine what we mean by “intellect.” We need to create a new sense of separation between what humans do and what AI can do. ^a7e54542

- As late as the 1960s, depression and bipolar disorder were lumped together under a single heading and understood to have a similar underlying cause. But it turns out that technology—specifically, the discovery of the drug lithium—was the key ingredient that we needed to pull them apart. ^28179a99

- In the late 1940s, a doctor named J.F. Cade, who apparently had entirely too much time on his hands, discovered that the urine of manic patients was toxic to guinea pigs. ^afe574a4

- This is a remarkable series of events for two reasons: One, it resulted in a drug, lithium, that has saved many thousands of lives over the decades since it was discovered. And two, it acted as what the psychiatrist Peter Kramer calls a “pharmacological dissection” that differentiated manic depression as a separate disease from depression, with its own biological cause. ^41f3a0d4

- But a drug, lithium—which cured manic depression, and only manic depression—helped carve the disease out as distinct from the rest of mental illness, and one that was fundamentally biological in origin. In other words, lithium was a lever that became a new lens on the way our minds work. ^cc239173

- What this means, in effect, is that LLMs aren’t very good at discovering new things thus far. But they _are_ incredible at bringing to bear human knowledge into any given area of inquiry, by effectively compressing and reformatting it in precisely the best way for it to be consumed. Its powers for increasing transmission and understanding of knowledge are better by far than any preceding innovation, from the book to the internet. ^b2cd1438

- Because the sum total of all human knowledge far outstrips any single person’s ability to remember it, we _need_ LLMs in order to have any hope of enacting all of the things humanity knows. ^57395be5

- I started to see that summaries are happening everywhere, all the time. Most of the emails I write are summaries, and so is most of the code I write. Even much of this article is a summary. ^b39fca17

- If summaries are everywhere in my work life, and ChatGPT can do summaries, what role do I have? The answer is obvious: There’s a large amount of things that need to be done to write a great essay. The fact that I don’t have to summarize as much is _fantastic._ ^cb1b2f41

- When I really sat down to think about this article, the interesting thing, the hard thing, was not the summary. It was everything else that went into it: the life experience, the diversity of reading sources, the emotional journey of interacting with ChatGPT and considering its implications. ^d1f22a09

- Summarizing skills are a kind of creative drudgery. I learned them out of necessity, but they’re no longer as useful as they once were. ^cf0ee90d

- A key point is that this doesn’t have to be specifically about summarizing. If ChatGPT had been good at finding out new knowledge and terrible at summarizing, I would instead extol the virtues of my human ability to summarize. This is good and natural: Humans, above all, are adaptable. I define what’s interesting by what I can uniquely do. ^738d0840

So what if ChatGPT can do _both_?

- Henrich writes, “\[T\]hese genetically evolved learning abilities aren’t simply downloading a cultural software package into our innate neurological hardware. Instead, _culture rewires our brains and alters our biology_—it renovates the firmware.”

In essence, our species—our psychology, biology, brains, and bodies—is shaped by culture. And culture is, to a large extent, a function of technology. Who we are is shaped by the technology we are surrounded by.  ^528839c7
