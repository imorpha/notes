# My Highlights

- 1. No one knows what a "game" is. ^aee41f31

- almost every theorist I've looked at has spent time at the beginning of their works comparing previous definitions of the term with their own, eventually coming up with a "working defintion." And there are plenty of valid ones. Just take a look at the definition pagefor "Game"to see what I mean. ^05a6fdfc

- 2. No one agrees on what anything is. ^54687ba5

- There does not seem to be a single coherent vocabulary for which to describe the field in general. Certain words are definitely important and have been put into good use by multiple theorists (emergence and coherence, for example), but one set of definitions still eludes the field. ^aa65a883

- 3. The field is multifaceted. ^399571e0

- It pays to draw from as many fields as possible in research, though the most useful split for the Wiki as it stands is that between academics (Bogost, Juul, Ruggill and McAllister) and game designers (Koster, Schell). ^05cb0b4b

- 4. Ludology vs. Narratology ^fe75c6e1

- This describes the debate between looking at games as primarily vehicles of play, unique from stories and other media (ludology) and seeing games primarily as unique forms of storytelling (narratology). ^b619b809

- Both sides have interesting implications for the medium as a whole -- the idea of violence, for example, is stripped away in Koster's description of the narrative as mere "dressing," while perhaps being examined from an experiencial perspective under the narratological lens. The general consensus is elements of both theories are true, and that the best games mix their gameplay with their story effectively. ^ad9acaff

- 5. The Question of Fun ^d45b9768

- What is thepoint of a game? To designers like Raph Koster, it is to have fun. Period. If a game isn't fun, it has failed as a game. Some, like the team behindExtra Credits, are wholly against this mindset, as they believe the focus on fun restraints the medium from being truly impactful and exploring a wide range of experience. ^c6af506e

- 6. The Question of Art ^06d8a5fe

- This, for me, is the big one: can games be considered forms of art? Many in the field seem to hold that they are, but as a whole our society does not share this appreciation. As such, scholars of games are faced with raised eyebrows and skeptical looks, and must fight for legitimacy (either through "duplicity" as Ruggill and McAllister explain, or by writing in the frustratingly obtuse style I encountered in my research.) ^1182da4b

- This issue has become the topic for debate, especially among the more narratologically minded, and will no doubt continue to intensify as the medium develops. Keep an eye on this one; it could be the future. ^b98c2490
