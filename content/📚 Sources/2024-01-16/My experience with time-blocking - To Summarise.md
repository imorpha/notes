# My Highlights

- Initially I was sceptical of time-blocking. It seemed similar to keeping a fixed timetable, which I’d previously tried unsuccessfully. The rigidity of a timetable was too constraining, and I couldn’t endure even a week before giving up. ^bfb04902

- But time-blocking is different in two significant ways: ^5af3f92f

- The planning occurs less than 24 hours in advance. By then, you’ll likely have a broad idea of what upcoming day might look like, and can get more specific about the tasks you need to do. ^78849cf3

- It allows flexibility to adjust on the fly. The point is not to “tie yourself to the mast” and execute the day exactly as you’ve planned. The point is simply to become more intentional about how you spend your time. ^e0164bd0

- Benefits of time-blocking ^cfe10964

-  ^de97c8cf

- 1\. Easier to do things that are time-consuming and important ^f96fb5e9

- Time-consuming and important things are hard to do without planning ^22138011

- Small tasks easily fit into our days — you don’t need to plan to find 10 minutes here or there to do them. However, anything that takes at least an hour usually requires some planning.

Moreover, important tasks are rarely urgent enough to become priorities unless we make them priorities. ^b4077a42

- When you time-block, you don’t have to decide how to spend each moment _in_ the moment. Instead, you find a quiet pocket of time to decide how you’ll spend your day. During this time, when you’re calm and composed, you’re more likely to prioritise the important and see what you need to actually execute on your intentions. ^2ec6b908

- By making it easier to do the time-consuming and “important but not urgent” tasks, time-blocking helps increase the overlap in the Venn diagram of how you _intend to_ spend your time and how you _actually_ spend your time.

- 2\. Brings our finitude into focus ^5653cbfa

- Finitude is the idea that our lives are finite, which means it’s impossible for us to do everything so we have to make trade-offs. ^b3513efe

- Time-blocking showed me that I didn’t have as much free time (or energy) as I thought I did. After some practice, I am now far more realistic about what I can reasonably accomplish in a week (though still not perfect by any means).

### 3\. Reduces negative feelings such as anxiety, guilt and decision fatigue ^a1b4c3d5

- An overhanging feeling of guilt that I “should” be doing something on the list pervades any downtime, no matter how well-deserved. Time-blocking alleviates this anxiety and guilt by reassuring my brain that I’ve already prioritised the most important tasks, and that the rest will eventually get done. ^5b58f9ed

- ## Drawbacks and common obstacles

### Interruptions and poor time estimates

As Newport points out in _Deep Work_, two common obstacles to time-blocking are:

1. You’ll get interrupted and have to revise your plan; and
2. You’ll underestimate the amount of time it takes to do tasks. ^b4f93375

- Facing your finitude head-on is confronting. When you find out you take longer than expected to do many tasks, you may experience feelings of failure or disappointment. ^058da54d

- Requires some predictability and control ^afe51dab

- But if you don’t know much about Paris and prefer to discover a foreign place by wandering around in it, time-blocking won’t be suitable. ^053e6a13

- Even though you can rearrange your plan when something unexpected crops up, you might not be able to realise the benefits of time-blocking if this happens too frequently. ^5d888d34

- Time-blocking takes extra time and planning ^b9de9203

- When you first attempt it, you may find it takes half an hour or more to think through everything you want to do for the day and estimate how long each task will take. But don’t worry; it won’t take that long every time. ^7573cbd7

- Conclusion ^80f76d21

- Also, it’s perfectly fine to time-block sporadically. Rather than being a daily habit, it could be something you deploy only when you require a heightened level of productivity.

So, to summarise:

* Time-blocking makes it easier to do time-consuming and important things (including, but not limited to, deep work).
* There are also other benefits, including bringing your finitude into focus and reducing negative feelings such as anxiety, guilt and decision fatigue.
* Initial challenges, such as interruptions and time underestimates, can be addressed by revising your schedule and using overflow conditional blocks.
* Time-blocking may not be suitable when you have little ability to predict or control your days.
* Although time-blocking can feel stressful to begin with, it gets easier over time. ^c1f697ed
