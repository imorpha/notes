# My Highlights

- Chapter 1: In the Beginning, There is the Designer ^ab6f165f

- However, the skill most important to Schell is listening – the empathy and attention any good game designer needs to give to their design team, their audience, their games, their clients, and themselves ^6c6c3477

- Chapter 2: The Designer Creates an Experience ^c5b0ec8e

- the end goal of games: the experiences they create ^d05b61c4

- as games tend to be non-linear experiences, the gap between the object and the experience is much more pronounced ^b06d7f37

- These experiences can be examined through practical approaches (such as anthropology, psychology, and general design principles) and careful and objective introspection (which goes back to the concept of “listening” from the last chapter). ^48ada1c9

- Finding an essential experience for the game to try to emulate is thus one of the most important aspects of game design, and becomes his first [lens](http://artofgamedesign.com/cards/lenses.htm). ^6d29b70e

- Chapter 3: The Experience Rises Out of a _Game_ ^8a5228f3

- Having established the link between the designer and essential experience, Schell begins to pick apart the connection between them: the [game](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Game "Game") itself. ^8704835b

- “**a game is a problem solving activity, approached with a playful attitude**” ^e0f89086

- Chapter 4: The Game Consists of _Elements_ ^60a75d88

- [Mechanics](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), [Story](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Story "Story"), [Aesthetics](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"), and [Technology](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Technology "Technology"). Schell calls this the [Elemental Tetrad](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Game "Game") ^8f4dd757

- the technology, for example, sets the parameters for the game, while the aesthetics of the sounds in the game made it much more intense than many of its predecessors ^e978da86

- a designer needs to have “holographic vision” while designing, so that they can see not only these four perspectives and how they interact behind the scenes in a game, but also what the player experiences directly. ^9ba11469

- Chapter 5: The Elements Support a _Theme_ ^9290b6c5

- “Figuring out a theme and using every means to support that theme” (49). "Every means" includes every element in Schell's Elemental Tetrad: [technology](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Technology "Technology"), [mechanics](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"), [story](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Story "Story"), and [aesthetics](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Aesthetics "Aesthetics"). ^b42bf748

- The best themes have what Schell calls “[resonance](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Resonance "Resonance"),” ideas that touch players deeply by fulfilling their fantasies (experience based theme) or affirming a powerful idea the player holds to be universally true, like “love conquers all” (truth based theme) ^8b7b8e6a

- Chapter 6: The Game Begins with an _Idea_ ^a822a3d3

- outlines the process of inspiration and idea formulation in general, providing tips on how to manage one’s creative subconscious (“Your Silent Partner,” 63) and how to brainstorm effectively (68-74). ^2b9a13c5

- Chapter 7: The Game Improves Through _Iteration_ ^09fe2a29

- the most effective way of making a game better is through building a rough prototype and actually testing it out. ^2632c410

- He outlines a couple of methods for judging these iterations, especially his eight filters of design (76-78), examples of risk assessment, and software engineer Barry Boehm’s spiral model of software development (82-83). ^f6863af3

- “The Rule of the Loop: The more times you test and improve your design, the better your game will be” ^42157974

- a gradual approach is key to any successful design, games or otherwise ^915b354c

- Chapter 8: The Game is Made for a _Player_ ^0919c6df

- He takes a very pragmatic approach to these issues, basing his [lists of masculine and feminine interests in games](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Gender%5FDemographics "Gender Demographics") on sales statistics and general psychological studies. ^23cfe9be

- The second half of the section is about[ game psychographics](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Game%5FPsychographics "Game Psychographics") – what types of people play what types of games. ^948bf759

- “Knowing your players more intimately,” Schell concludes, “is the key to giving them a game they will enjoy,” ^cbf9df23

- Chapter 9: The Experience is in the _Player's Mind_ ^a6e0b5ae

- The first section, "[Modelling](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Chunking "Chunking")", points out how the brain processes the complexities of reality through essentializing images and information, cutting them down to their most basic elements in order to understand them. ^bcace246

- Games provide “pre-digested models that are easy to absorb and manipulate,” so the designer has a lot of power over what the player sees as “reality” (117). ^ed01d312

- The second part, "Focus", draws upon [Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly%5FCsikszentmihalyi)’s concept of [flow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow%5F%28psychology%29) as a model for finding the right balance between challenge and player skill in any given game, assuring the players do not quit out of boredom or frustration (121). ^05ac70ff

- Next, Schell spends time discussing empathy and imagination as ways of players immersing themselves in a game experience, and how designers can encourage these mental traits in their games. ^3403d532

- An interesting discussion on motivation follows this, in which Schell maps gaming’s tendencies to connect people, boost self-esteem, and allow for creativity onto to third through fifth levels of [Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's%5Fhierarchy%5Fof%5Fneeds), elevating the fulfilling function of games in general (126-127). ^ce8454fc

- Finally, Schell ends the chapter with a brief emphasis on the fourth level of Maslow’s hierarchy – self-esteem – and how games provide areas for safe and fair judgment that fulfill this innate human need (128). ^28486cac

- Chapter 10: Some Elements are Game _Mechanics_ ^2eb9ac05

- According to Schell, there are six categories of game [mechanics](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"): space, objects, actions, [rules](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Rules "Rules"), skill, and chance. ^9c37e091

- This leads to a brief discussion of [emergence](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Emergent%5FSystems "Emergent Systems") – how simple actions can combine to make complex phenomena – and how to foster emergence in a given game. ^71881c97

- Chapter 11: Game Mechanics Must be in _Balance_ ^e4425175

- game balance, a nuanced practice Schell describes as “the most artful part of game design” ^89548f4a

- Schell begins by listing the [Twelve Most Common Types of Game Balance](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Game%5FBalance "Game Balance") and how to implement them effectively ^c7a608ed

- improve one’s intuitive sense by practiced guesswork and planning balancing ahead of time. ^9d732e92

- balancing is more about a game’s “feel” than any formulaic assessment ^6b9e04bb

- Chapter 12: Game Mechanics Support _Puzzles_ ^9e3817d9

- He defines a puzzle as “a game with a dominant strategy” early on in the chapter (209), emphasizing how puzzles are solvable and lose their appeal after they are solved (unlike most games.) ^bd3d544e

- ten principles for making good puzzles that enhance rather than interrupt a game’s experience. ^a35e715a

- Chapter 13: Players Play Games Through an _Interface_ ^b576d9d5

- the interaction between the player, the game world, and the real world. ^4898d8b7

- All video games have a physical interface (a control scheme/set of physical inputs and outputs) and a virtual one (the display, the pause screen, the visual aspects, etc.). Both of these interfaces work together with the goal of being transparent and intuitive enough that the player can immerse themselves in the game world without having to worry about fidgeting with clunky controls or bad display. ^67e17d3f

- a good interface provides good feedback, gives the player a lot of satisfying control (he calls this “juiciness”), and communicates all the information necessary to play the game. ^87c48d85

- Chapter 14: Experiences Can be Judged by Their _Interest Curves_ ^39c30140

- A good game (or any good experience) has a dynamic interest curve, with peaks and valleys of interest leading to a climactic end, similar to the rising action/falling action construction of many books, plays, or movies. ^baf252e1

- break down “interest” into three constituent parts (inherent interest, poetry of presentation, and projection) ^553d8280

- since not all games are linear, how can a designer control a player’s interest (260)? ^15729286

- Chapter 15: One Kind of Experience is the _Story_ ^3620ae2c

- “Historically,” according to Schell, “stories have been single-threaded experiences that can be enjoyed by an individual, and games have been experiences with many possible outcomes enjoyed by a group” (262). This all changed with the advent of single player computer games, which married story and gameplay and sparked an ongoing debate between which ought to have precedence in game studies (game-centric ludology vs. story-centric narratology.) ^d63a05b4

- a game designer is really after experiences, which have been most effectively accomplished by a combination of both (263). ^1e3c0951

- dispel the idea of “passive entertainment” – that games, compared to literature or cinema, are “truly interactive” (263). While the player does interact in a game setting, any good piece of storytelling similarly fosters engagement with an experience and makes them question the outcome the story’s events. As such, both forms of storytelling (“traditional” and “new”) are more alike than different, and would do well to learn from each other. ^85c2ef2b

- “The Dream,” as he puts it, is to create a completely interactive world in which the player has complete freedom to live out a story (264). ^74e64f9c

- there are two major story-telling methods that have worked for video games: the [string of pearls](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/String%5Fof%5FPearls "String of Pearls") method (moments of freedom interspersed through a constant storyline) and the [story machine](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Story%5FMachine "Story Machine") method (relatively open ended worlds which players ascribe meaning to) (264-266.) ^217eb620

- The real problems with the dream of a completely interactive story, Schell explains, have appeared in minor forms within both of these effective story methods. For one thing, game stories often do not have unity, partly because games thrive on having multiple meaningful choices. Secondly, the amount of time, energy, and data required to make a completely interactive experience makes the idea unfeasible, and cutting corners by fusing together some plotlines defeats the purpose. Similarly, multiple endings are often disappointing to the player, who would have to spend time and energy replaying the game to find new meaning in it. ^9edf2cb4

- games are focused around a particular set of engaging verbs – running, jumping, shooting – which make more subtle storytelling elements difficult to portray. ^c8f2c714

- unless a game is to end completely upon the death of the avatar, save games, check points and other “time travel” make certain stories (like tragedy) almost impossible to recreate in game form. ^73a4c6c5

- Schell does not believe the dream should be abandoned, just refocused on experiences over story (270). ^e8017926

- Chapter 16: Story and Game Structures can be Artfully Merged with _Indirect Control_ ^ccfe094c

- Though Schell holds that freedom (or at least the illusion of it) is an important aspect of games in general, he holds that designers can manipulate a player’s experience through methods of [indirect control](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Indirect%5FControl "Indirect Control"). ^f70bdc82

- these methods, which include: limiting player choices with constraints; setting specific goals; designing an interface so it hints at a specific skill set; visual design choices; and music that fits a given mood. ^cfd0246b

- use non-player characters to lead players into specific situations in a method he calls “[collusion](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Collusion "Collusion").” ^d86c8dda

- Used correctly, these methods can give the designer some control over the player’s experience of the game, while still making the player feel as if they have a sense of freedom. ^d3482b9d

- Chapter 17: Stories and Games Take Place in _Worlds_ ^b1f5eb7d

- Schell borrows from theorist Henry Jenkins when he says that worlds are transmedial: they extended outward beyond the medium they were originally composed for through the strength of their aesthetic and thematic draw (Schell 301). ^ac8f1977

- When viewed from this perspective, games are doorways into a “magic place that exists only in the imaginations of \[the player\],” another aspect to consider when creating stories for games (307). ^2d1e7071

- Chapter 18: Worlds Contain _Characters_ ^5bd578fd

- compared to the mental, realistic, and complex characters of novels and film, many game characters tend to be involved in more physical conflicts, tied to more fantastic worlds, and are often portrayed in more simple terms (311). ^25fd3b0b

- However, Schell believes that game characters are not doomed to follow these models, and must be made more meaningful to appeal to a maturing audience (311). ^92ba47ab

- the avatar, a character that is often most successfully portrayed as an idealized blank slate which the player can project themselves on (312-313). ^d9fd7083

- Chapter 19: Worlds ContainSpaces ^f0ee2195

- tips for creating meaningful characters, which include defining their archetypical roles, giving them relationships with other characters, and making them face character-building challenges. ^e213f633

- Drawing heavily upon architecture (a field which, to Schell, is also about “controlling a person’s experience,” 330), this chapter focuses on the use of [space](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Space "Space") in games. ^4a957ad9

- the five main ways of organizing space in games: linear (Monopoly or platformers like _Super Mario Brothers)_; grid (chess, _Civilization_); web (Trivial Pursuit, or games like _Zork_); points in space (bocce, or many large scale roleplaying games like _Final Fantasy_); and divided space (Risk, _Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_). ^70789652

- architect [Christopher Alexander’s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher%5FAlexander) approach to architecture: the search for a nameless quality of space that is among other things “free from inner contradictions” (334). ^9e40fb9d

- He then applies Christopher’s [fifteen properties of living structures](http://www.truthtable.com/Fifteen%5FPrincples.html) to game design, emphasizing the same search for that nameless quality. ^f03ce51d

- designers have more freedom to create in a virtual world, but run into troubles that come from working with non-real materials such as inconsistent unit sizes and making things look realistic in a third person or top down perspective. ^2a3d937c

- Chapter 20: The Look and Feel of a World Is Defined by Its _Aesthetics_ ^9a31c17d

- aesthetics are important to game design for multiple reasons, including providing a hook, increasing immersion, and just providing pleasure to the player (347). ^a44a663e

- From a design standpoint, Schell advises the concept artist be active from the very early stages of the game’s production in order to create a product that looks unified. ^0ca9915c

- That being said, unlike in many other mediums, technical limitations must be taken into account throughout the process and often the final aesthetic arises from quirks in the technology. ^d341d31a

- Chapter 21: Some Games are Played with _Other Players_ ^b635dd5a

- competition, collaboration, meeting up, exploring our friends, and exploring ourselves. ^428701f6

- Though multiplayer experiences can fulfill many innate social needs through any of these methods, Schell cautions that adding multiplayer features make any game project significantly more complicated, and should be approached with care. ^41bed521

- Chapter 22: Other Players Sometimes Form _Communities_ ^469741bc

- Amy Jo Kim’s succinct definition of community: “a group of people with a shared interest, purpose, or goal who get to know each other better over time” (358). ^93a9e393

- a strong community is beneficial to a game because it fulfills a social need for players and keeps more people interested in the world for a longer amount of time. ^51f244c2

- focus on integrating different player types into the community and preventing bad behavior among players (mainly through methods of indirect control.) ^9c0a52ae

- Chapter 23: The Designer Usually Works with a _Team_ ^d497d51a

- focuses on the production cycle, beginning with how to work in teams. ^deb2cd53

- designers interested in keeping their team cohesive, productive, and in communication ^c96d147a

- Chapter 24: The Team Sometimes Communicates Through _Documents_ ^fe3817f7

- on the technical writing that goes along with game design, from story overviews to concept art reviews to budgeting documents. ^c0115377

- there is no single format for a master game design document, so it is up to each designer to ensure that the team receives documentation that keeps records in a clear and concise manner. ^719a23e5

- Chapter 25: Good Games Are Created Through _Playtesting_ ^ea5653dc

- Following from the philosophy that the best games are tested through multiple iterations ^180055f0

- the specific considerations of playtesting – that is, watching others play a game in order to see if it achieves the desired experience. ^96401a10

- tips on when and where a playtest should be held, whom it should be done by, and how to effectively evaluate testers without interrupting the experience. ^f467e1cb

- Chapter 26: The Team Builds a Game with _Technology_ ^0ab400ed

- The last part of the [Elemental Tetrad](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Game "Game") to be treated, Schell spends this chapter exploring the issues that arise from [Technology](https://game-studies.fandom.com/wiki/Technology "Technology"). ^0ceb0a2c

- There are two types of technology: foundational technology (which make new kinds of experiences possible) and decorational technology (which just make existing experiences better) (Schell 405). ^90818867

- Schell gives multiple examples of games in order to distinguish the two before addressing the issues that come with trying to predict upcoming technologies. ^36817392

- Schell advocated for determining what technology is needed to create a given game experience before trying to integrate a new system surrounded by hype (i.e. motion controls), as this will ultimately lead to a more unified experience. ^6816583b

- Chapter 27: Your Game Will Probably Have a _Client_ ^9e4acf30

- tips for positive communication with those who may not understand the ins and outs of game design. ^691a2d3e

- it is good to make the client feel as though they are part of the creative process in some capacity, even if their ideas do not end up getting implemented. ^5439a762

- Chapter 28: The Designer Gives the Client a _Pitch_ ^a71df3d7

- tips for the business side of game design, namely refining a short, interesting pitch about the game to win over clients. ^ae601b8d

- Schell’s general piece of advice it getting to know the audience and tailoring the information to their needs and interests. ^f3f7b592

- Chapter 29: The Designer and the Client Want the Game to Make a _Profit_ ^9d1c9562

- the economics of game design: who is involved with game production, what proportion of the proceeds go to each producer, and how to approach business situations. ^ab42b69b

- financial jargon to help would-be designers seem more capable in the boardroom (437-438). ^64e57e43

- Chapter 30: Games _Transform_ Their Players ^ce283d94

- the transformative power of games, especially in a psychological and educational context. ^93541533

- the positive effects of games, which include emotional maintenance, social connection, and (for some games) reason to exercise (442-443). ^61c1f561

- the possible educational uses of games, especially for conveying facts in an interesting way, fostering problem solving, providing hands-on opportunities, and encouraging curiosity as students attempt to explore the system itself. ^4c9f748a

- potentially harmful aspects of games, namely the debates about games’ violent content and their potentially addicting natures. ^179c628d

- games, taken independently, almost certainly do not encourage these behaviors, but that does not mean a designer ought to disregard these concerns. Instead, a designer needs to act responsibly and be aware of what impact they could be making. ^e878bb4a

- Chapter 31: Designers Have Certain _Responsibilities_ ^1b1c2c97

- a call to all would-be game designers to take their intended profession seriously. ^4e65791a

- Though games may not cause harm on their own, there is always the potential that any medium will be dangerous in some capacity. ^a8a8c305

- Part of being a game designer, to Schell, is trying to find the “hidden agenda” lurking within each game (456). This is not an attempt to dodge controversy, but an understanding that “games are not just trivial amusements” (456). They are impactful, and a designer is responsible for much of this impact. ^3df503e8

- Chapter 32: Each Designer has a _Motivation_ ^1b57d7c5

- a personal send-off which encourages the reader to find their own motivation for making games and stick by it in order to reach their true potential as a game designer. ^1aeb5498
