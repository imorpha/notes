It's an interesting form of learning, when it happens as a side effect. I for one learned English in a way much similar to a native speaker: at a young age, by trying to understand the dialogue in Warcraft III. As a result, I can now intuitively use certain grammar structures without having formally studied them.

This type of learning has its pros and cons. The first disadvantage that comes to mind is the fact that it has to be done over the long-term, and we usually don't have enough time for that. As an adult, we don't have that luxury; learning has to be done quickly and efficiently. However, the advantage is undeniable: it leads to a much more deeper and ingrained understanding, while requiring minimal effort.

Take, for example, writing Evergreen Notes, which are concise, concept-oriented, and adhere to the principle of atomicity. This method of note-taking enhances writing skills for tests like the TOEFL, where a topic sentence in an essay can parallel the title of an Evergreen Note.

However, I struggle to find examples of learning as a side effect outside the realm of language. This might be because language is often the medium through which we achieve and learn anything else. The question then becomes how we should incorporate this approach to learning into other areas that aren't just a means to an end, but the end itself.
