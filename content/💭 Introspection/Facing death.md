There is a certain clarity of mind that results from facing death. One would be lucky to have a near-death experience and continue living, thereby feeling all the regrets that people often have later in life—or more accurately, too late in life—much sooner. It is one thing to 'know', intellectually, what it means to have a finite time on this planet; it is a whole other thing to actually 'feel' it in your flesh and bones. That form of confrontation is only possible when facing the actual inevitability of a death soon to come.

I was lucky enough to have such an experience, but I still don't know if I'm lucky enough to live, at the time of writing this. What I know is this: to die in the state that I am currently in, would be a complete and utter tragedy, and I don't want it to be that way.
