I've come to notice that publishing what I create encourages me to do it more, faster, and better. In the case of writing, it makes me write more clearly and in a more structured way. However, this goes against Andy Matuschak's advice to [write note for yourself by default, disregarding audience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXDPrYcxUSZbF5M8vM5Y1U9). He goes on to state the following:

> Many of these practices can be somewhat useful as part of your own thinking process—for instance, clearer writing usually involves clearer thinking. But I find it substantially increases the overhead and effort in writing, often to the point of producing blockage.

There haven't been any such blockage for me so far. I _am_ writing notes for myself, but imagining the possibility of someone else reading my notes, encourages me to write more cohesively, which in turn makes me think more clearly.

I currently start writing directly in a publishable form, without any drafts. I have no "private" notes on Obsidian—excluding the actually private ones. This may change in the future; I might need a kind of buffer between what I think and what I publish.
