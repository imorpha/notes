habits from your environment.

[NEW HABIT].”

avoiding your bad habits.  

- Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits
obvious and visible.  

- Increase friction. Increase the number of steps 
between you and your bad habits.  

- Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do 
with an action you need to do.  

- Use a commitment device. Restrict your future
choices to the ones that benefit you.  

- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal
behavior.  

- Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy
immediately before a difficult habit.  

- Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to
watch your behavior.

habits public and painful.  

- Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between 
you and your good habits.

make future actions easier.  

- Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices
that deliver outsized impact. 

- Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until 
they can be done in two minutes or less.  

- Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime 
purchases that lock in future behavior.  

- Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward 
when you complete your habit.  

- Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad 
habit, design a way to see the benefits.  

- Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and
“don’t break the chain.” 

- Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure 
you get back on track immediately
