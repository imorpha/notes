## Highlights

- What makes me come alive?

Seriously, close your eyes and consider:

The last time you **dropped into a flow state** and tapped into your creative genius.

Or the last time you were immersed in **your zone of genius** solving a highly-complex problem.

Or when your **childlike joy and curiosity** emerged and made time melt away.

Hey friend ðŸ‘‹

Itâ€™s **_RAD_** to have you here.

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/300x0,s02RyJ5J_cH52KWkywCutNfQTGtNaTOhA8pZmGLSVHjY/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/taWn4dpmSgXWHgFvLFdWSc/email)

We use that word often here, friend.

"Rad" is our homage to _The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles_ (and 90â€™s surf-skate culture).

But really it's because of this definition:

And you, my friend, **are effortlessly cool.**

Now that weâ€™ve established that, youâ€™re probably wondering:

Why am I here?

Whatâ€™s in it for me?

We gotchu. Just read on.

## No frogs. No cold showers. No Inbox Zero.

You're getting this email because you subscribed to another amazing creator who recommended you to check out RadReads - and I'm honored you decided to do so.

Now, our team knows a thing or two about productivity.

In fact, weâ€™ve written 400+ posts on this topic over the past decade.

![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/800x0,snRjx3ahGvjzmxJ0TovckNmaq2_mce9X8ExuMd7f4gDY/https://embed.filekitcdn.com/e/soCyR57pgxv3XZJLXQFY1r/dnwHNjYfY8UAdGAXkJDVHD/email)

Yup, weâ€™ve written about Inbox Zero, time boxing, the Eisenhower Matrix, procrastination, Tabata burpees, career pivots, the Superhuman Email app, Deep Work, Text Expanders and much much more.

These are all nifty tactics.

Yup, you and I both know that they work.

And they make your life better.

But these tactics have a short shelf life. Theyâ€™re like squeezing water out of a stone.

Will _Eating the Frog_ help you **free yourself from an overbearing boss** (who doesnâ€™t believe in remote work)?

Is a fancy system to _organize your Kindle highlights_ **really going to get you to start writing your email newsletter?**

And will the _hottest to-do list app_ eliminate your **perfectionism-disguised-as-procrastination?**

## You can make time for what matters. (Or you can make time for email)

Friend, we salute all these **tiny tactics.**

(We also call these low-value tasks, **$10 Work** â€” more on that tomorrow.)

But letâ€™s zoom out on your life, just for a brief minute.

If youâ€™re overwhelmed by the ratcheting demands of modern life, I want you to ponder the following question:

==What makes me come alive?==

==Seriously, close your eyes and consider:==

==The last time you== **==dropped into a flow state==** ==and tapped into your creative genius.==

==Or the last time you were immersed in== **==your zone of genius==** ==solving a highly-complex problem.==

==Or when your== **==childlike joy and curiosity==** ==emerged and made time melt away.==

This **aliveness** usually gets lost in the world of back-to-back Zoom calls and the endless firehose of email.

## RadReads is your guide to a productive, examined and joyful life

These questions (i.e. your **$10K Work**) are what truly move the needle in your life.

Theyâ€™re gateways to truly understanding yourself.

And with that self-awareness you can tap into **your creativity.**

**Your resilience.**

And **your brilliance.**

Thatâ€™s what our Rad squad is about.

## So, hereâ€™s what to expect

For the next 5 days, weâ€™re going walk you through a series of frameworks that you can start applying immediately.

The emails are **short and actionable**.

And full of dad jokes.

But before we go, Iâ€™ve got one question for you:

What makes you come alive?

There's no right or wrong answer. Just tell us **by hitting REPLY** and share your aliveness. Family, hobbies, causes, learning and art are all super valid answers.

Hereâ€™s my answer.

Every morning, my daughter's tiny hand guides me through our neighborhood and to kindergarten. We act silly, wave to friends and observe the palm trees around us. After a "hug-kiss-fist-bump," I grab my surfboard and run to the beach and jump into the water. Rinse-lather-and-repeat!

So your turn, my friend.

Just reply to this email.

My team and I **read every. Single. Email.**

With love and gratitude,

Khe + The RadReads team
