I have always had a voice in my head, telling me what the right thing to do is at the moment. That voice, however, was largely ignored by me over the years. The voice talks about many things, ranging from doing my TOEFL exercises to my purpose in life. Although, they all share a common theme: living intentionally. I always intend to do something, but I don't.

What makes a person not live according to their values and intentions? It certainly isn't lack of mindfulness, at least not for me. The problem isn't that I'm not aware, because I am. It is just that I don't act on what I know to be right.

Is this due to ingrained habits and the finiteness of willpower? Are we forever shackled to the primal parts of our brains, while the human part is simply too weak to overcome it and take control? Should the change be gradual and incremental over an extended period of time, or do we need a profound, sudden insight—like [[Facing death|facing death]]—to bring about fundamental change? _Can we change?_

I may not know any of this, but I know one thing to be true: I can trust that voice more than anything in this world.
